<h2>Hello World</h2>
<p>April, 25th 2015</p>
<p>So, I'm very excited to have secured the sub-domain <code>paul.js.org</code> as part of the fantastic <a href="http://js.org" target="_blank" title="JS.ORG | JavaScript Community">js.org</a> project - giving away free sub-domains to any javascript developer looking for a place to host their <a href="https://github.com" target="_blank" title="github">github</a> projects.</p>
<p>I'll be treating this domain as a showcase for all my javascript projects, as well using it as a sort of blog, sharing snippets and mentioning any other peoples projects that look interesting. <em>Stay tuned!</em></p>
