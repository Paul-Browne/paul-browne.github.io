CURATOR V'S BOOTSTRAPS
======================

Bootstraps is a fantastic project, but it has beome a victim of its success, in that bootstrap's built websites all 
look very similar - you can often tell a bootstrap's website the second it loads.
If you are interested in using bootstraps, then PLEASE check out [bootswatch](https://bootswatch.com)


1. Responsive Images
    Curator includes a solution for swapping images dependant on device size and pixel density straight out the box
    
2. Check, Radio, Select and Validate
    Bootstraps styles checkboxes, radio buttons and select boxes but not to the same degree, it also doesn't have a built in validator
    
3. 



FUTURE
======
    
1. As browser standards improve, hopefully, we can drop the need for jQuery - I'm always on the lookout for vanilla plugins
2. General evolution - As trends come-and-go, i'll update Curator accordinally
3. Bug fixes 'n pull requests
